### Hello! I'm Jahziel :)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is just one of the places where I explore the joy of computing online. You can also find me:

- My WWW home: https://web.jahziel.xyz
- My Gemini home: gemini://gemini.jahziel.xyz
- Fediverse: https://thecabal.xyz/@hapax

Lately, my projects revolve around learning more about systems programming. I'm getting better at Rust, so you'll probably see a lot of that around here. Feel free to contribute to any of my projects! I love getting to know people through the magic of Open Source. See you around!

PS: My name is pronounced like it's in Spanish (haw-zee-el).
